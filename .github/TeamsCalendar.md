## Teams Calendar Guidance
In an effort to utilize Teams, the Calendar feature could help our crews standardize how we setup cadences for scrum ceremonies and creating events/vacation invites for visibility.  Instead of having to create a calendar invite and remembering everyone that you need to forward it to, the Teams Calendar function automatically creates an invite that includes all of the people in the “Austin RDC” Teams channel. We have identified two areas to starting using this feature: 

Scrum Ceremonies - Scrum ceremonies will be sent out through Teams (Austin RDC) following the name convention of [Project Name] - [Ceremony] (I.e. WCNP - Standup+). This will provide a central place to look for all ceremonies where Austin RDC members can participate and/or listen in. 

Vacation Days/Time Off - PTO and time off will be sent through Teams calendar following the naming convention of [Individual Name] - [OOF, Personal Appt] (i.e. Paula - OOF). This will alleviate the task of manually sending invites and not forgetting anyone. 


### Instructions
- You MUST have “Austin RDC” checked off in your Outlook calendar under Groups
- You can either create an invite through Teams Calendar or Outlook (Images below demonstrating both)
- If you are using the Outlook mobile app, the “Austin RDC” group is not automatically checked off in your calendar, you need to check it off in order to see this 
- You can forward this invite to someone outside of “Austin RDC” group (such as external stakeholders), it will be visible to them

### Things to Note/FAQ 
- All Team Calendar invites are visible to the entire Teams Channel through Outlook
- Who has access? “Channel calendar app can be used by the members of the team. However, this app is restricted for guests i.e. Any member of that specific team’s channel can organize a meeting which is only accessible by the specific members of that channel. Guest members neither see the Channel calendar tab nor access it.” 
- Team calendar events cannot be created in “private channels” 
- External attendees are able to join these meetings
- If you forward your Teams Calendar invite to an external party, they will see it on their calendar but only that invite. They will not see any historical invites on their calendar 
   - Note: if they accept or decline, as organizers - you will not get email notified. However if you click on the invite, you will if the parties have accepted or declined your invite.
