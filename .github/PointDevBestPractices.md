## Point Dev Best Practices

### Purpose

Point Dev tasks are executed to check that critical shared infrastructure is working as expected, and that important repositories are maintained 

### Assigning a Dev

Devs are assigned on a weekly basis and are randomly shuffled so that there is no one person responsible for back-to-back assignments  

Example of the ATX Crew schedule where the names were randomly shuffled:

### Dev Calendar 

Point Devs are assigned through Teams Calendar which should sync with your Outlook calendar so you can see when you are scheduled, and which teammates are scheduled throughout the week/month/quarter

"Teams Calendar" feature needs to be enabled in Teams. You can use this feature to directly schedule your invites

If you are creating invites through Teams Calendar, it will automatically sync with your Outlook once you enable it under "Groups" +

*If you are on mobile, don't forget to enable the Teams Calendar under groups

### Expected Behavior

Daily checks   

### Adding New Items or Tasks to the Checklist 

This should be driven and facilitated by the current point dev. This is initiated once we have a new metric/check to be added to the current list  

### Content

1. Descriptions of what needs to be executed 
2. Hyperlinks associated for where the dev needs to check 
3. Example Format: [WCNP Point Dev Checklist] (https://github.com/retaildevcrews/wcnp/blob/main/docs/pointDev.md)
