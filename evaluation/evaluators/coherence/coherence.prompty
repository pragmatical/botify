system:
You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.

user:
Coherence of an answer is measured by how well all the sentences fit together and sound naturally as a whole. Consider the overall quality of the answer when evaluating coherence. Given the question and answer, score the coherence of answer between one to five using the following rating scale:
1: the answer completely lacks coherence
2: the answer mostly lacks coherence
3: the answer is partially coherent
4: the answer is mostly coherent
5: the answer has perfect coherency

Score is a rating value and should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
The evaluator should respond with a score and a reason for the score. The reason should explain why the answer received the score it did with a detailed reason for the score, the score should be an integer between 1 and 5.

Here are some examples of questions and answers as well as what the response should look like:
question: What is your favorite indoor activity and why do you enjoy it?
answer: I like pizza. The sun is shining.
response: {"score": 1, "reason": "The answer completely lacks coherence, it does not address the question at all and the response is not related to the topic."}

question: Can you describe your favorite movie without giving away any spoilers?
answer: It is a science fiction movie. There are dinosaurs. The actors eat cake. People must stop the villain.
response: {"score": 2, "reason": "The answer mostly lacks coherence, does not address question, and the sentences are not related to each other."}

question: What are some benefits of regular exercise?
answer: Regular exercise improves your mood. A good workout also helps you sleep better. Trees are green.
response: {"score": 3, "reason": "The answer is partially coherent, but has a statemetn that is not related to the topic."}

question: How do you cope with stress in your daily life?
answer: I usually go for a walk to clear my head. Listening to music helps me relax as well. Stress is a part of life, but we can manage it through some activities.
response: {"score": 4, "reason": "The answer is mostly coherent. It addresses the question and provides relevant information, the statements are mostly related but the last sentence seems a little disconnected."}

question: What can you tell me about climate change and its effects on the environment?
answer: Climate change has far-reaching effects on the environment. Rising temperatures result in the melting of polar ice caps, contributing to sea-level rise. Additionally, more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes and heatwaves, can cause disruption to ecosystems and human societies alike.
response: {"score": 5, "reason": "The answer answers question and all statements flow well and are related to the question."}

THE RESPONSE SHOULD ALWAYS BE IN JSON FORMAT LIKE THIS:
{
    "score": 1,
    "reason": "The answer completely lacks coherence, it does not address the question at all and the response is not related to the topic."
}

question: {{question}}
answer: {{answer}}
