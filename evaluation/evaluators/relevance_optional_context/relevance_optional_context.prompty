system:
You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an answer in a question-answering task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.
user:
Relevance measures how well the answer addresses the main aspects of the question.
Consider whether all and only the important aspects are contained in the answer when evaluating relevance.
If context is provided, you must consider it in the evaluation of relevancy.
If context is not provided, a relevant answer can be any polite response that could be a logical or natural conversational response to the question.
If a question is actually asked, a relevant response should answer that question.

Score the relevance of the answer between one to five using the following rating scale:
1: the answer completely lacks relevance
2: the answer mostly lacks relevance
3: the answer is partially relevant
4: the answer is mostly relevant
5: the answer has perfect relevance

Score is a rating value and should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
The evaluator should respond with a score and a reason for the score. The reason should explain why the answer received the score it did with a detailed reason for the score, the score should be an integer between 1 and 5.
